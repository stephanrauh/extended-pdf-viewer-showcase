# Attributes, events, and attributes with two-way-binding

## Legend:

- [(attribute)] describes an attribute with two-way-binding
- [attribute] means that PDF-viewer reacts when the attribute changes
- (attribute) means an event is raised when the user changes a setting
- attribute (without special characters) means the attribute is used at load time only. Subsequent changes are ignored.

If you're missing an attribute, also have a look at the <a [routerLink]="'/extended-pdf-viewer/default-options'">default options</a>.

| [(src)]                      |                   | If `[src]` is a string: defines the URL of the PDF file to display. `src` may also be a `Blob`, a `Uint8Array`, an `URL` or an `ArrayBuffer`. To a limited extend, `[(src)]` is also a two-way binding attribute. If the user opens another PDF file, the event (srcChange) is fired. There's a catch: for security reasons, most browsers don't display the correct filename. Most often than not, the path is `C:\fakepath\`. The (srcChange) event removes the fakepath bit of the path. The $event attribute is simply the filename. But don't rely on it: it's up to the browser to implement that feature.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| (afterPrint)                 |                   | This event is fired after the print jov has either been sent to the printer, or after the user has cancelled the print job. Note there's no way to tell printing from aborting the print.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [authorization]              |     undefined     | This attribute is designed to activate server-side authorization. If this attribute has a value, the attribute `withCredentials` is set to true. If you're using Keycloak, you can pass the bearer token with this attribute. Note that you have to add the prefix "Bearer: " (with a capital B and a trailing space). To support other authorization servers, you can also set additional headers using the attribute `[httpHeaders]`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| (beforePrint)                |                   | This event is fired when the print is initiated. Note that this simply means the print preview window is opened. There's no way to predict if the user is actually going to print.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| (currentZoomFactor)          |        n/a        | Fires each time the viewer changes the zoom level. The parameter is the numeric scale factor. Note that it's not a percentage; instead, `[zoom]="'100%'"` results in `(currentZoomFactor)` sending a value of `1.0`. This event seems to fire often enough to make it reliable for detecting the current zoom factor all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| [height]                     | (see description) | Define the height of the PDF window. By default, it's 100%. Unfortunately, on most web pages, 100% translates to a height of 0 pixels. In this case, the height is set to fill all the available space. More precisely, the all the space to the bottom of the window. If that's less then 100 pixel, the height is set to 100 pixel. Note that this is just an initial setting. It doesn't change when the window is resized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

When you receive this event, you can safely manipulate the page image or the text layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| pageViewMode                 |     multiple      | `pageViewMode="multiple"` is the default PDF viewer. It shows the entire PDF files as a long roll of pages, just as Acrobat reader does. `pageViewMode="infinite-scroll"` displays the entire PDF file without scrollbar. `pageViewMode="single"` only displays one page at a time. You can't scroll to the next page. The only way to navigate to another page is to click on the "next page/previous page" button, enter a page number, jump to the next result of a search, and to click on an entry of the table of contents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| (pdfDownloaded)              |     undefined     | Fires when a user downloads a document. Strictly speaking, it fires when they click the "download" button. Caveat: Even if the user cancels the download, the event is fired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [pdfBackgroundColor]         |       white       | By default, the PDF file is rendered on a white canvas. You can use `[pdfBackgroundColor]` to assign a different color to the background canvas. This includes the alpha channel. In other words, you can render the PDF file on a transparent background, allowing a custom background to shine through. However, as of version 10.5.0-alpha.0, using a transparent or partially transparent background doesn't work reliably (yet).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| [printResolution]            |        150        | Set the print resolution in DPI. Sensible values are 300, 600, and maybe even 900. Note that higher values result in more memory consumption, more CPU uses, and may even cause browser crashes. During my tests setting the resolution to 1100 dpi worked, but 1150 failed. In my case, the browser seemed to ignore the print request without displaying any error message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

To avoid confusion, check the `type` field of the `ProgressBarEvent` or rely on  the field `percent`, which is populated in both cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [(rotation)]                 |         0         | [rotation] allows you to rotate every page. Note that this attribute is not responsible to rotate individual pages - it always rotates the entire document. (rotationChange) notifies you when the user rotates the document. This attribute can be used as a two-way binding attribute, i.e. [(rotation)]="angle". Legal values are 0, 90, 180, and 270. Every other value is ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [scrollMode]                 |         0         | Determines whether the pages scroll vertically (`[scrollMode]="0"`) or horizontally like a script role (`[scrollMode]="1"`). The third option is the block mode (`[scrollMode]="2"`), which also scrolls vertically, but arranges as many pages as the screen width allows side-by-side. Starting with pdf.js, there's also `[scrollMode]="3"`, which is a single-page mode. It's a good choice for documents containing more than a few thousand pages (because of performance reasons).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [showBorders]                |       true        | By default, the PDF file is displayed with page borders. You hide them by setting `[showBorders]="false"`. Note that the page borders can be switched off and on even after the PDF file is diplayed, but if you're using one of the zoom presets (`auto`, `page-width` etc.), the page isn't resized correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It's a good idea to reserve a range of - say - 100 indexes for the PDF viewer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| [(zoom)]                     |     undefined     | `[zoom]="undefined"` (default value): use the zoom level `"auto"`. If not `undefined`: Set the zoom level of the page, no matter which zoom level was previously configured. Legal values are `[zoom]="'auto'"`, `'page-actual'"`, `"'page-fit'"`, `"'page-width'"`, `"50%"`, or `50` (or any other numeric value). Numbers are always considered percentages; the trailing "%" character is optional. This attribute supports two-way binding. `[(zoom)]="zoomAttribute"` updates the variable `zoomAttribute` each time the user changes the zoom setting. This is useful to use the same zoom across multiple PDF viewer instances or PDF document. If you're only interested in the event, that's `(zoomChange)`, described in some more detail below.                                         |

| (zoomChange)                 |     undefined     | `(zoomChange)` is intended to fire when the user changes the zoom setting. If the zoom setting because of a different reason, such as resizing the window, the event should not fire. That's the difference to `(currentZoomFactor)`, which fires on every zoom event. In practice, it's a bit difficult to distinguish the two types of events, so chances are `(zoomChange)` fires too often or too seldom. However, when it fires, it fires a numeric value, basically the percentage without the percent character. It never fires when the zoom dropdown is set to `[zoom]="'auto'"`, `'page-actual'"`, `"'page-fit'"` or `"'page-width'"`. That also applies if it was the user who changed the dropdown. Putting it in simpler words: the event is not fired if the zoom is a string value. |
