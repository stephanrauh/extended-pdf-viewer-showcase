# Attributes, events, and attributes with two-way-binding

## Legend:

- [(attribute)] describes an attribute with two-way-binding
- [attribute] means that PDF-viewer reacts when the attribute changes
- (attribute) means an event is raised when the user changes a setting
- attribute (without special characters) means the attribute is used at load time only. Subsequent changes are ignored.

If you're missing an attribute, also have a look at the <a [routerLink]="'/extended-pdf-viewer/default-options'">default options</a>.

| (annotationEditorEvent)           |                            | This event is fired when the user add, edits, or removes an editor annotation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| (afterPrint)                      |                            | This event is fired after the print jov has either been sent to the printer, or after the user has cancelled the print job. Note there's no way to tell printing from aborting the print.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| (beforePrint)                     |                            | This event is fired when the print is initiated. Note that this simply means the print preview window is opened. There's no way to predict if the user is actually going to print.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| (currentZoomFactor)               |            n/a             | Fires each time the viewer changes the zoom level. The parameter is the numeric scale factor. Note that it's not a percentage; instead, `[zoom]="'100%'"` results in `(currentZoomFactor)` sending a value of `1.0`. This event seems to fire often enough to make it reliable for detecting the current zoom factor all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| (pageRender)                      |         undefined          | Fires each time a page is about to be rendered. Emits an instance of `PageRenderEvent`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| (pageRendered)                    |         undefined          | Fires each time a page has finished rendering. Emits an instance of `PageRenderedEvent`. The `pageNumber` attribute tells you which page has been rendered. When you receive this event, you can safely manipulate the page image or the text layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| (annotationLayerRendered)         |         undefined          | Fires each time a page has finished rendering the annotation layer (i.e. forms or the stuff added by the editor buttons). Emits an instance of `AnnotationLayerRenderedEvent`. The `pageNumber` attribute tells you which page has been rendered. When you receive this event, you can safely add text, images, or drawings to the annotation layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| (pagesLoaded)                     |         undefined          | _Broken since version 19!_ Emits the number of pages when a document is loaded; more precisely: emits an instance of `PagesLoadedEvent`. The attribute `pagesCount` tells how many pages the document has. The source attribute contains a reference to the PDF viewer. You can also use this event to detect when a document has been loaded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| (pdfDownloaded)                   |         undefined          | Fires when a user downloads a document. Strictly speaking, it fires when they click the "download" button. Caveat: Even if the user cancels the download, the event is fired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| (pdfLoaded)                       |         undefined          | Emits when the PDF file has been load successfully.

| (zoomChange)                      |         undefined          | `(zoomChange)` is intended to fire when the user changes the zoom setting. If the zoom setting because of a different reason, such as resizing the window, the event does not fire. That's the difference to `(currentZoomFactor)`, which fires on every zoom event. In practice, it's a bit difficult to distinguish the two types of events, so chances are `(zoomChange)` fires too often or too seldom. However, when it fires, it fires a numeric value, basically the percentage without the percent character. It never fires when the zoom dropdown is set to `[zoom]="'auto'"`, `'page-actual'"`, `"'page-fit'"` or `"'page-width'"`. That also applies if it was the user who changed the dropdown. Putting it in simpler words: the event is not fired if the zoom is a string value. |

| [(pageLabel)]                     |         undefined          | Two-way binding attribute to determine the page to display; more precisely: `[pageLabel]="25"` makes the PDF viewer show the page the author called page "25". This may or may not be a numeric value. For instance, many books use roman numbers for the preface and arab numbers for the rest of the document. In this case, `[pageLabe]="iv"` usually refers to the same page as `[page]="4"`. `[(pageLabel)]="attribute"` updates the attribute each time the user scrolls to another page. If you're only interested in the event, that's `(pageLabelChange)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [(rotation)]                      |             0              | [rotation] allows you to rotate every page. Note that this attribute is not responsible to rotate individual pages - it always rotates the entire document. (rotationChange) notifies you when the user rotates the document. This attribute can be used as a two-way binding attribute, i.e. [(rotation)]="angle". Legal values are 0, 90, 180, and 270. Every other value is ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [(sidebarVisible)]                |         undefined          | Two-way-binding attribute determining whether the sidebar is visible. If you're only interested in the event, the event name is `(sidebarVisibleChange)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [(spread)]                        |            off             | Determines if you're seeing one page or two pages at once (like a paper book). `'off'` means there's only one page. `'odd'` is the traditional book-like view, with two pages side-by-side. `'even'` is similar, only the first page is displayed alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [(src)]                           |                            | If `[src]` is a string: defines the URL of the PDF file to display. `src` may also be a `Blob`, a `Uint8Array`, an `URL` or an `ArrayBuffer`. To a limited extend, `[(src)]` is also a two-way binding attribute. If the user opens another PDF file, the event (srcChange) is fired. There's a catch: for security reasons, most browsers don't display the correct filename. Most often than not, the path is `C:\fakepath\`. The (srcChange) event removes the fakepath bit of the path. The $event attribute is simply the filename. But don't rely on it: it's up to the browser to implement that feature.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [(zoom)]                          |         undefined          | `[zoom]="undefined"` (default value): use the zoom level `"auto"`. If not `undefined`: Set the zoom level of the page, no matter which zoom level was previously configured. Legal values are `[zoom]="'auto'"`, `'page-actual'"`, `"'page-fit'"`, `"'page-width'"`, `"50%"`, or `50` (or any other numeric value). Numbers are always considered percentages; the trailing "%" character is optional. This attribute supports two-way binding. `[(zoom)]="zoomAttribute"` updates the variable `zoomAttribute` each time the user changes the zoom setting. This is useful to use the same zoom across multiple PDF viewer instances or PDF document. If you're only interested in the event, that's `(zoomChange)`, described in some more detail below.                                       |
| [acceptKeys]                      |           (none)           | Accepts a comma-separated list of keys. For example, a legal value is `"['P', 'N']"`. Every key in the list is accepted, and every other key is ignored. In the example, the key "n" navigates to the next page but "k" does not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [authorization]                   |         undefined          | This attribute is designed to activate server-side authorization. If this attribute has a (string) value, the attribute `withCredentials` is set to true. If you're using Keycloak, you can pass the bearer token with this attribute. Note that you have to add the prefix "Bearer: " (with a capital B and a trailing space). To support other authorization servers, you can also set additional headers using the attribute `[httpHeaders]`. Sometimes you need to set the `withCredentials` attribute without setting the `authorization` header. If set, set `[authorization]="true"`.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

If you have to use an older 21.x version and can't update, use `pdfDefaultOptions.needsES5 = true;` instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [height]                          |     (see description)      | Define the height of the PDF window. By default, it's 100%. Unfortunately, on most web pages, 100% translates to a height of 0 pixels. In this case, the height is set to fill all the available space. More precisely, the all the space to the bottom of the window. If that's less then 100 pixels, the height is set to 100 pixels. Note that this is just an initial setting. It doesn't change when the window is resized. You can also use `[height]="auto"` to use all the available screen estate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The third option is the block mode (`[scrollMode]="2"`), which also scrolls vertically, but arranges as many pages as the screen width allows side-by-side. Starting with pdf.js, there's also `[scrollMode]="3"`, which is a single-page mode.

| [showBorders]                     |            true            | By default, the PDF file is displayed with page borders. You hide them by setting `[showBorders]="false"`. Note that the page borders can be switched off and on even after the PDF file is diplayed, but if you're using one of the zoom presets (`auto`, `page-width` etc.), the page isn't resized correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| [showHandToolButton]              |           false            | Show or hide the "hand tool" menu item in the secondary toolbar. (The hand tool allows you to move the page by clicking and dragging). This activates also the opposite menu item: "text selection tool". As a side effect, the hand tool also activates the "text layer". This, in turn, enables marking text and highlighting search result.

If you insist, ngx-extended-pdf-viewer allows you to display signatures by setting `[showUnverifiedSignatures]="true"`. Note that you also have to disable form support. Also note that ngx-extended-pdf-viewer adds a hint making the reader aware of the potentially falsy signature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

You can set this flag to load the human-readable files. However, in most cases this shouldn't be necessary due to the source map files. Using the human-readable files give you a performance penalty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| [(pageViewMode)]                  |          multiple          | `pageViewMode="multiple"` is the default PDF viewer. It shows the entire PDF files as a long roll of pages, just as Acrobat reader does. `pageViewMode="infinite-scroll"` displays the entire PDF file without scrollbar. `pageViewMode="single"` only displays one page at a time. You can't scroll to the next page. The only way to navigate to another page is to click on the "next page/previous page" button, enter a page number, jump to the next result of a search, and to click on an entry of the table of contents. Starting with version 17.3.0, this attribute is a two-way binding attribute.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| textLayer                         |         undefined          | Allows you to activate or deactivate the text layer. If this flag is set to false, both the "find" button and the "select tool" are hidden. If you don't set this flag explicitely, it's automatically set by `[handTool]` and `[showHandToolButton]`. The text layer is shown by default if and only if `[handTool]="false"` or `[showHandToolButton]="true"`. As a rule of thumb, you always want to activate the text layer unless you run into performance problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
