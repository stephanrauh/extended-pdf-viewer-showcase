  <h2>Features you can customize</h2>
  <p>
    <code>&lt;ngx-extended-pdf-viewer&gt;</code> allows you to customize the toolbar and the menu of the PDF viewer.
    You can
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>re-arrange the pre-defined items any way you like;</li>
    <li>replace existing items by custom items - including your own icons, texts, and tooltips;</li>
    <li>and add your own buttons, menu items, and even menus, implementing custom functions I can't even imagine.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>But how to document this feature?</h2>
  <p>
    I'm afraid you can't avoid reading the sourcecode of the UI. You find it
    <a
      href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/blob/main/projects/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/src/lib/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer.component.html"
    >
      in the GitHub repository of <code>&lt;ngx-extended-pdf-viewer&gt;</code></a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>Nonetheless, I'm optimistic I can give you a head start with a couple of demos and a few hints:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First of all, <a href="/custom-toolbar">this interactive demo</a> shows a few example implementations.</li>
    <li>
      The default UI naturally forms a tree. Below, you'll find a high-level abstraction of this tree. Your customization doesn't have to
      follow this structure. It's just the default.
    </li>
    <li>The customization hooks defined by <code>&lt;ngx-extended-pdf-viewer&gt;</code> allow you to modify certain subtrees. Currently there are nine hooks:
    <ul>
      <li><code>[customToolbar]</code> allows you to modify the entire black bar above the PDF document.</li>
      <li><code>[customFreeFloatingBar]</code> allows you to add your own toolbar. The original use-case is a toolbar floating above the PDF file. But if you're familiar with CSS magic, you're probably not limited to that.</li>
      <li><code>[customSecondaryToolbar]</code> represents the menu at the right-hand side of the PDF viewer.</li>
      <li><code>[customFindbar]</code> allows you to define your own findbar.</li>
      <li><code>[customFindbarButtons]</code> allows you to modify the entire find bar (the black bar that's shown after typing <code>CTRL+F</code>).</li>
      <li><code>[customFindbarInputArea]</code> is responsible for a small part of the find bar: the input field and the previous/next buttons.</li>
      <li><code>[customSidebar]</code> defines your own sidebar. See <a href="/extended-pdf-viewer/custom-sidebar">the custom sidebar demo.</a> </li>
      <li><code>[customThumbnail]</code> See <a href="/extended-pdf-viewer/custom-thumbnails">the custom thumbnails demo.</a></li>
      <li><code>[customPdfViewer]</code> is your door to modify everything except the CSS imports.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      The underlying PDF framework, pdf.js, recognizes the buttons and menu items by their <code>id</code>. If you want to modify an
      existing functionality, keep in mind you have to provide the id. Otherwise, pdf.js might raise an exception, and your custom button
      won't work.
    </li>
    <li>However, most buttons are component you can either use or copy. You can see the full list of toolbar buttons
      <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/blob/main/projects/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/src/lib/toolbar/pdf-toolbar/pdf-toolbar.component.html">
        in the GitHub repository of <code>&lt;ngx-extended-pdf-viewer&gt;</code>.
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm sure there's a lot of headroom for improvements. Don't hesitate to report any shortcoming on
      <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues">the bugtracker of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Toolbar</h2>
  <p>The toolbar is the black bar containing the buttons above the PDF file.</p>
  <p><b>Legend:</b>The red text tells you which id the component renders internally. When you use the component, don't add the id. Otherwise,
  the id is used twice. In many cases, this causes errors. However, since version 18, most buttons
  replaced the pdf.js implementation by an Angular implementation, so the ids aren't as important as they used to be
  in earlier versions.</p>
  <p><b>Breaking Change in version 22:</b> Some of the ids have changed: <code>#print</code> is now <code>#printButton</code>,
     and <code>#download</code> is now <code>#downloadButton</code>.</p>
  <app-tree [treeData]="toolbar"></app-tree>

  <h2>Findbar</h2>
  <p>The findbar becomes visible after hitting <code>CTRL+F</code>.</p>
  <app-tree [treeData]="findbar"></app-tree>

  <h2>Secondary menu (since version 18)</h2>
  <p>
    Since version 18, almost every button is able to move dynamically from the toolbar to the secondary menu.
    The idea is to move buttons from the toolbar to the secondary menu until the toolbar fits on the screen,
    so small displays can still show all buttons.
  </p>
  <p>Every toolbar button has a <code>show&lt;ButtonName&gt;</code> attribute which defines the breakpoint of
  the button. If the screen is wider than the breakpoint, the button is displayed in the toolbar. Otherwise
it's displayed in the secondary menu. There are also two special values: <code>always-visible</code> means
the button is never moved to the secondary menu. Conversely, <code>'always-in-secondary-menu'</code>
means the button always hides in the secondary menu.</p>
<p>There's an interactive live-demo at <a href="/extended-pdf-viewer/responsive-design">the responsive design page of this showcase.</a></p>
<p>If you use the <code>&lt;pdf-shy-button&gt;</code> component to define your custom buttons they also
benefit from responsive design. However, there's a catch: if you're using the <code>&lt;pdf-shy-button&gt;</code>,
you can use the `action` attribute to define custom logic. Basically, the `action` attribute is treated like a fat arrow function -
and that means it's inheriting the `this` reference from the `PdfShyButton` class. The constructor of your button component
is never called, and neither is <code>ngOnInit</code>. Probably that sounds more confusing than it is, so
don't worry - it's easy to implement custom "shy" buttons. Just keep in mind that <code>this</code> is not
what you might expect.</p>

<h2>Adding custom buttons to the toolbar and/or the secondary menu</h2>
<app-ie11-markdown src="/assets/extended-pdf-viewer/responsive-design/custom-buttons.md"> </app-ie11-markdown>

  <h2>Secondary menu (before version 18)</h2>
  <p><b>Important:</b> This section describes how the seondary menu worked in older versions.
  The old customizations should still work in version 18+, but I recommend migrating to the new
approach because it's both simpler and more flexible.</p>
  <p>The secondary toolbar is the menu that opens on the right-hand side. It contains many buttons
    of the primary toolbar. On small displays, widgets are shifted from the primary toolbar to the
    secondary toolbar until the primary toolbar fits on the screen. Similarly, when the window size
    gets larger, many items are shifted from the secondary toolbar to the primary toolbar.
