| enableHWA                            | Enable hardware acceleration. The default value is <code>true</code>. If you're running into rendering issues, try setting this flag to <code>false</code>. Note that this flag is only avaible in pdf.js 4.4 and above, and that it's the exact opposite of the flag <code>activateWillReadFrequentlyFlag</code> that has been removed in version 21.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| assetsFolder                         | URL of the assets folder (relative to the <code>index.html</code>). Changing this attribute modifies the value of the default options <code>cMapUrl</code> and <code>workerSrc</code>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| annotationMode                       | Setting this flag to `AnnotationMode.DISABLE` (0) disables forms. Other values are `AnnotationMode.ENABLE` (1), which is the default and includes all possible annotations; `AnnotationMode.ENABLE_FORMS` (2), which excludes annotations that contain interactive form elements (those will be rendered in the display layer); `AnnotationMode.ENABLE_STORAGE` (3), which includes all possible annotations (as above) but where interactive form elements are updated with data from the {@link AnnotationStorage}-instance; `ENABLE_STORAGE` is probably only useful for internal use, e.g. for printing, but not useful for library users.                                                |
| defaultZoomDelay                     | When you zoom a page using a pinch gesture, it's initially zoomed using fast but inaccurate CSS. After the <code>defaultZoomDelay</code>, the page is re-rendered. The default is 400 milliseconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| disableHistory                       | stop storing the user settings of PDF files; default value: <code>false</code>. Note that this flag does something different than in pdf.js. With ngx-extended-pdf-viewer, it disables using the <code>LocalStore</code> entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| ignoreDestinationZoom                | Ignore the zoom argument in the destination array. Among other things, this flag is useful if the PDF author has added the zoom factor to the table of contents. You can see this in the "simple demo": each time you click an entry of the table of contents, the zoom is set to "page fit". Setting `ignoreDestinationZoom=true` prevents this. The default value is <code>false</code>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| imageResourcesPath                   | Path for image resources, mainly for annotation icons.

| fontExtraProperties                  | Include additional properties, which are unused during rendering of PDF documents, when exporting the parsed font data from the worker-thread.

The default value is <code>false</code>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| isEvalSupported                      | Determines if we can evaluate strings as JavaScript. Primarily used to improve performance of font rendering, and when parsing PDF functions.

| maxImageSize                         | The maximum allowed image size in total pixels, i.e. width \* height. Images above this value will not be rendered. Use -1 for no limit, which is also the default value. Note that the browser also limits the image size. ngx-extended-pdf-viewer tries to reduce the size of images that are larger than the browser allows, but this doesn't always work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| workerSrc                            | URL of the worker file. By default it's <code>./assets/pdf.worker-x.y.z.min.js</code>. You can modify this option if your worker file is at a different location or if the resolution of the relative path doesn't work for some reason. This value can either be a string or a lambda. The default implementation takes `pdfDefaultOptions.assetsFolder`, `[minifiedJSLibraries]`, and `[forceUsingLegacyES5]` into account to determine the path (see <a target="#" href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/blob/16f986f729716b583522f515b45ca2b39c84437c/projects/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/src/lib/options/pdf-default-options.ts#L87">the source code on GitHub</a>). |
