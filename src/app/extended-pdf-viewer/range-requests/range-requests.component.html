  <h1>Range requests and streaming</h1>
  <p>
    Sometimes PDF files are large, even huge. By default, the PDF loader doesn't load the entire PDF file. Instead, it loads it in chunks,
    and it uses streaming if the server allows it to do so. So the viewer can display the first page while it's still loading the other pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the time, you don't have to configure this feature (unless you want to switch it off). It just works. If it doesn't, check if
    your server supports range requests. If it does, the response headers have the attributes
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>"Content-Length"</code></li>
    <li><code>"Accept-Ranges": "bytes",</code></li>
    <li><code>"Content-Encoding"</code></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>CORS</h2>
  If your PDF file is served by a different server than the Angular application, you must add the CORS headers to the response. Here's a simple demo
  server sending the correct headers:

  Kudos go to Chetan Patil who helped me figure this out.

  <p>If you want to dig deeper: Vishal Patel has written a article on <a href="https://medium.com/@vishal1909/how-to-handle-partial-content-in-node-js-8b0a5aea216">range requests</a>
    and how to implement them in a simple node.js server.</p>

  <h2>Getting rid of range requests and lazy loading</h2>
  <p>
    The <a href="/options">default options</a> <code> disableStream</code> and <code>disableAutoFetch</code> allow you to switch off the feature.
    In most cases, this means it takes longer until the PDF file is shown, so use this option only as a last resort.
  </p>
  <p><b>Caveat:</b> When I tried this, I didn't manage to disable range request. Chances are the feature is broken.</p>
