# Attributes, events, and attributes with two-way-binding

## Legend:

- [(attribute)] describes an attribute with two-way-binding
- [attribute] means that PDF-viewer reacts when the attribute changes
- (attribute) means an event is raised when the user changes a setting
- attribute (without special characters) means the attribute is used at load time only. Subsequent changes are ignored.

| [(src)]                      |                 | If `[src]` is a string: defines the URL of the PDF file to display. `src` may also be a `Blob`, a `Uint8Array` or an `ArrayBuffer`. To a limited extend, `[(src)]` is also a two-way binding attribute. If the user opens another PDF file, the event (srcChange) is fire. There's a catch: for security reasons, most browsers don't display the correct filename. Most often than not, the path is `C:\fakepath\`. The (srcChange) event removes the fakepath bit of the path. The $event attribute is simply the filename. But don't rely on it: it's up to the browser to implement that feature, and if you add the page to the "trusted pages" list in the Internet Explorer, the fully qualified file name is provided.                                                                     |

Note there's no way to tell printing from aborting the print.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [authorization]                |    undefined    | This attribute is designed to activate server-side authorization. If this attribute has a value, the attribute `withCredentials` is set to true. If you're using Keycloak, you can pass the bearer token with this attribute. Note that you have to add the prefix "Bearer: " (with a capital B and a trailing space). To support other authorization servers, you can also set additional headers using the attribute `[httpHeaders]`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| (beforePrint)                |                 | This event is fired when the print is initiated. Note that this simply means the print preview window is opened.

| (currentZoomFactor)          |       n/a       | fires each time the viewer changes the zoom level. The parameter is the numeric scale factor. Note that it's not a percentage; instead, `[zoom]="'100%'"` results in `(currentZoomFactor)` sending a value of `1.0`. This event seems to fire often enough to make it reliable for detecting the current zoom factor all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| delayFirstView               |        0        | Number of milliseconds to wait between initializing the PDF viewer and loading the PDF file. Most users can let this parameter safely at it's default value of zero. Set this to 1000 or higher if you run into timing problems (typically caused by loading the locale files after the PDF files, so they are not available when the PDF viewer is initialized).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| textLayer                    |    undefined    | allows you to activate or deactivate the text layer. If this flag is set to false, both the "find" button and the "select tool" are hidden. If you don't set this flag explicitely, it's automatically set by `[handTool]` and `[showHandToolButton]`. The text layer is shown by default if and only if `[handTool]="false"` or `[showHandToolButton]="true"`. As a rule of thumb, you always want to activate the text layer unless you run into performance problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| [(zoom)]                     |    undefined    | `[zoom]="undefined"` (default value): use the zoom level `"auto"`. If not `undefined`: Set the zoom level of the page, no matter which zoom level was previously configured. Legal values are `[zoom]="'auto'"`, `'page-actual'"`, `"'page-fit'"`, `"'page-width'"`, `"50%"`, or `50` (or any other numeric value). Numbers are always considered percentages; the trailing "%" character is optional. This attribute supports two-way binding. `[(zoom)]="zoomAttribute"` updates the variable `zoomAttribute` each time the user changes the zoom setting. This is useful to use the same zoom across multiple PDF viewer instances or PDF document. If you're only interested in the event, that's `(zoomChange)`, described in some more detail below.                                         |
| (zoomChange)                 |    undefined    | `(zoomChange)` is intended to fire when the user changes the zoom setting. If the zoom setting because of a different reason, such as resizing the window, the event should not fire. That's the difference to `(currentZoomFactor)`, which fires on every zoom event. In practice, it's a bit difficult to distinguish the two types of events, so chances are `(zoomChange)` fires too often or too seldom. However, when it fires, it fires a numeric value, basically the percentage without the percent character. It never fires when the zoom dropdown is set to `[zoom]="'auto'"`, `'page-actual'"`, `"'page-fit'"` or `"'page-width'"`. That also applies if it was the user who changed the dropdown. Putting it in simpler words: the event is not fired if the zoom is a string value. |
